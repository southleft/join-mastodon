# Create a #Introduction Message and Pin It to Your Mastodon Profile Feed

In general, it is a good tactic to write an introductory Mastodon message, so you then pin this to your Mastodon profiles. It is a plus to use the hashtag #Introduction on this post as well, along with any other hashtags that are topic areas you care about and discuss.

When someone views your profile, pinned posts will be the first thing they see - and first impressions count - so we do recommend taking care with this introduction.

On Mastodon, you may post up to five pinned messages, and these are all featured as "pinned" or listed ahead of any other posts you do. For these pinned messages, you can choose which order they are seen, and we suggest making your "introduction" post the first one shown before any of the others.

To pin a post on Mastodon, we recommend these steps:

1. Log in to Mastodon using the web user interface.
2. Write your introduction post, and add then add this hashtag to the message: "#Introduction".
3. Select this new social media post that you now want to pin, and start by selecting the ... icon on the post and then select _Pin to profile_.
4. **SUCCESS:** You should see that the post is now pinned to your profile. To unpin it, click ... on the post again, and then select _Unpin_.

To change the order of pinned posts on your Mastodon profile, simply do this: Unpin a post and repin it to move it up the list of pinned posts.
